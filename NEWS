   + xlbiff.form used by default
   + xlbiff.form moved to nmh's config directory, so "scan" can find it
   + Developers: Test logging and robustness improved
   + Developers: -debug output is line-buffered, not fully buffered

 * Version 4.5.6  (28 Nov 2021)
   + Developers: Tests use Xvfb directly, eliminating xvfb-run script.

   + Developers: Add tests of the window behavior of Popup and Popdown

   + Intervals can be floating point: -update, -fade, and -refresh
   + Null-terminate message scan output (error found by Coverity Scan)
   + HISTORY file renamed to NEWS

 * Version 4.5.2  (12 Apr 2021)
  + Popup problem fixed where a screen size change would move the
    xlbiff widget as needed but then realize it even if it was
    supposed to be unrealized.  Bug introduced in version 4.5.
  + Doc: "Customizing" section moved from README.md to xlbiff.man

   + remove old "porting" section
   + remove old "things to be aware of" section

 * Version 4.5  (7 Dec 2020)

   + scanCommand works even if user has not run mh-install

 * Version 4.3  (7 Sept 2020)
   + Removed "international: True" X resource.
     This was added in 4.2 and changed font resources incompatibly.
     Users for whom "international" was useful, or who had already updated
     their resources to handle it, can get the 4.2 behavior back by adding
     the following line to an X Resources file or -xrm argument:
     *international: true
   + Update default font resource with the font's current name
   + Changed default mail path directory to /var/mail from /usr/spool/mail

   + Install xlbiff.form to /usr/local/share/mh, not /usr/new/lib/mh
   + Developers: Build process changed from Imake to Autotools.
   + Developers: Assume modern C library and compiler.

 * Version 4.2  (16 May 2017)
   + Primitive i18n support
   + minor code cleanup (whitespace, warnings)
   + Again, update email addresses and URLs

 * Version 4.1  (8 Nov 2003)
   + improved Bcheck and Bscan
   + updated email addresses, URLs
   + Packaged for Debian release

 * Version 4.0  (2 June 1994 for X11R6 contrib tape)
   + expand functionality of "checkCommand"
   + include "bulk" scripts, taking advantage of checkCommand
   + general cleanup

   From Stephen Gildea <gildea@x.org>
   + don't call XBell() if volume is zero (workaround for bug
     in certain X terminals).

 * Version 3.1  (unreleased)

   From Bjoern Stabell <bjoerns@stud.cs.uit.no>
   + add *mailerCommand resource and functionality

 * Version 3.0 (released 26 Oct 92)
   + miscellaneous bug fixes

   From Gary Weimer <weimer@ssd.kodak.com>
   + add "sound" resource -- allows playing any sound on popup.

   From Neil O'Sullivan <Neil.OSullivan@eng.sun.com>
   + add "fade" resource -- pops window down after certain time.

 * Version 2.1 BETA

   From  Daren W Latham <dwl@mentat.udev.cdc.com>
   + add -refresh and -led options.
   + handle WM_DELETE_WINDOW.

   From Peter Fischman <peterf@ima.isc.com>
   + Add some comments to Makefile.std to help out SYSV'ers

   From Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>
   + Lots of cleanup in the default resources.

   From Yuan Liu <liu@cs.UMD.EDU>
   + Handle remapping better, don't vanish when WM restarts.

   From me:
   + add ErrExit routine, do some more cleanup.
   + output error message if scan fails, but don't die.
   + add ledPopdown option.
   + add checkCommand option (after lots of pestering by Mark!)

 * Version 2.0 submitted for X11R5 contrib tape  Fri  4 Oct 1991
   + no change, just up rev level

 * Version 1.5 submitted for testing  Thu  3 Oct 1991

   From  Jhon Honce <honce@spso.gsfc.nasa.gov>
   + change 'maxWidth/maxHeight' to 'columns/rows'.  Bottom option
        was broken and I hadn't even noticed!

   From me:
   + I need to track revisions better...

 * Version 1.4 submitted for testing  Thu  3 Oct 1991

   From  Arthur Castonguay <arthurc@doe.carleton.ca>
   + ignore stat() errors, treat them as empty file.

   From Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>
   + use XtPop{up,down} instead of {,un}mapWidget.

   From several or myself
   + change .width resource to .maxWidth to fix strange bug.
   + yet more portability fixes and cleanup.

 * Version 1.3 submitted for testing  Tue  1 Oct 1991

   From Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>
   + use allowShellResize and {,un}map instead of {,un}realize so
        it tracks position changes.
   + clean up .ad file
   + raise window to top of stack on new mail.
   + add 'resetSaver' option.

   From Mike Schroeder <mike@geronimo.pcs.com>
   + don't pop up if results of scanCommand are null.  This is
        useful for mail(1)-based users since the mailbox size will
        normally be >0 but that may not indicate new mail.

   From several
   + remove ANSI C dependencies.
   + use XtAppAddTimeOut() instead of alarm()/sleep()/setjmp().
   + clean up a bit.

   From me
   + add 'bottom' resource to preserve old functionality if you
        want to keep xlbiff at the bottom of your screen.

  * Version 1.0 posted to alt.sources  Thu 19 Sep 1991


Background
==========

  I wrote xlbiff because I don't always want to read my mail.  Regular
  xbiff lets me know when I have mail but not what it is -- this makes
  me have to inc(1) just so I can decide if I want to bother reading it.
  Xlbiff gives me a much better indication of whether or not I want to
  take time to read a new message.  If I don't, I just click it away
  and continue with what I'm doing.

  Before xlbiff, I wrote a crude hack using perl and xmessage.  It worked,
  but I had always wanted to do it right.
