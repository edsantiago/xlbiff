  <summary>Mail notification pop-up with configurable message scans</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
    Xlbiff presents enough information to tell you: Is this new mail worth
    reading right now?  And it stops distracting you once you decide.
    </p>
    <p>
    Xlbiff waits in the background, monitoring your mailbox file or IMAP
    server (or running your custom check-mail script).  When a new message
    arrives, it invokes the MH scan(1) command (or your custom
    mail-scanning script) and pops up a window with the output (typically
    the From and Subject line of each new message).  If more mail arrives,
    xlbiff scans again and resizes its preview window accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
    Clicking the left mouse button anywhere in the window causes it to
    vanish.  It will also vanish if the mailbox becomes empty.  Xlbiff
    stays out of your way when there is no new mail and pops up only
    when something requests your attention.
